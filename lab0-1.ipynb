    "The `torch`-y way to perform this computation is to rely on vectorized computations. Doing so is a bit tricky however. We need to reshape the matrices a bit. We start by turning the two-dimensional $A$ matrix from a $m \\times n$ matrix (rows by columns, which may differ in the general case) into a three-dimensional $m \\times 1 \\times n$ matrix. Here's the result of that operation on the $4 \\times 4$ `distances` matrix, using [the torch `view` method](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/tensor_view.html). We'll refer to the reshaped matrix below as the $A$ matrix henceforth. It will now be a tensor with 4 elements, each of which has 1 element, each of which has 4 elements (that are scalars)."

    "Now if we add these two matrices componentwise, what do we get? Each of the four 1 $\\times$ 4 elements in $A$ corresponds to the same single 4 $\\times$ 4 element in $B$, so they'll be added componentwise; that single element in $B$ will be \"broadcast\" to each of the rows in $A$. Thus, the first element in $A$ (`[[0., 1., 2., 6.]]` in the example) is to be added to the single element in $B$ (`[[0., 1., 2., 6.], [1., 0., 2., inf], [2., 2., 0., 3.], [5., inf, 3., 0.]]` in the example). How does this work? Going one more level in, we now have that the single 4-element element `[0., 1., 2., 6.]` in $A$ corresponds to (and will be broadcast to) each of the four 4-element elements in the single element in $B$ (the first of which is also `[0., 1., 2., 6.]`). Now, we've reached a set of elements that are all the same size as the element to be broadcast, so they are added elementwise, yielding `[0., 2., 4., 12.]` as the first summed 4-element element. The same thing happens for each of the other three elements in the reshaped $B$ matrix element. Zooming out one step, we repeat this procedure for each of the other three 1 $\\times$ 4 elements of $A$, broadcasting them onto the single 4 $\\times$ 4 element of $B$. When all is said and done, we'll have an $m \\times p \\times n$ matrix. Each outermost element of the summed matrix corresponds to a broadcast of a 1 $\\times$ 4 element of $A$ onto the 4 $\\times$ 4 element of $B$.\n",
    "\n",
    "As another way to understand this process, we want to compute the elementwise sum of a matrix $A$ of size 4 $\\times$ 1 $\\times$ 4 with another matrix $B$ of size 1 $\\times$ 4 $\\times$ 4. If both matrices were of size 4 $\\times$ 4 $\\times$ 4, there would be no problem. However, the first dimension of $A$ is of size 4 whereas the first dimension of $B$ is of size 1. Therefore, we repeat $B$ 4 times along the first dimension, expanding it into a matrix of size 4 $\\times$ 4 $\\times$ 4. Now the first dimension works out, but the second dimension of $A$ is of size 1 whereas the second dimension of $B$ is of size 4, so we also need to repeat $A$ 4 times along the second dimension, expanding it into a matrix of 4 $\\times$ 4 $\\times$ 4. Now both $A$ and $B$ have been expanded into size 4 $\\times$ 4 $\\times$ 4, and we can directly compute their elementwise sum. This hidden expanding operation is exactly the broadcasting we've referred to above."

    "How does this matrix translate to the $A_{ik} + B_{kj}$ additions we did before? To illustrate by example (indexing starting from 0), let's think about $(A \\star B)_{1, 2} = \\min_k A_{1, k} + B_{k, 2}$, where $A$ and $B$ now refer to the original 4 $\\times$ 4 `distances` matrix that we started with. The $A_{1, k}$s would be found in the second element of `summed`, which is where we broadcasted the second (index 1) row of $A$. Since this matrix is symmetric, the $B_{k, 2}$'s would be equivalent to the $B_{2, k}$'s, which would be found in the second row of each element of `summed`. Taking these two pieces of information together, we then look at the second row of the second element of `summed`. Indeed, $A_{1, 0} + B_{0, 2} = A_{1, 0} + B_{2, 0}$ would be the first element in the third row of the second element of `summed`, and this is true for each $k$. This tells us that to find our `minplus` result, we just need to find the minimum of each row of every element of `summed` (using the `min` method), and there are $4 \\cdot 4$ such rows. Note that this solution only works for symmetric matrices - for non-symmetric matrices, you'll need to transpose `distances` before you reshape it into a $1 \\times 4 \\times 4$ tensor."
